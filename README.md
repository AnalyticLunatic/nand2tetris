#nand2tetris project solutions

##About
nand2tetris is a from the ground up computer architecture course. The course is geared toward self learners,
and all the associated tools are open source.

##Cheating
The creators of nand2tetris ask that people [don't post code](http://www.nand2tetris.org/terms.php)
They believe that it will deprive students from self discovery.

If you find yourself stuck on a problem it might be best to ask in the [forums](http://nand2tetris-questions-and-answers-forum.32033.n3.nabble.com/)
they provide. Or even feel free to drop me an email and ask how I solved a problem,
but don't cheat yourself and read my answers. I am using GitHub for the free hosting, and
I learned a lot by comparing my answers to others. Other people wrote MUCH better code than I.
